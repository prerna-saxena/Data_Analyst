It seems like I can’t do more advanced data analysis right now. Please try again later.

However, you can still create the comprehensive order report manually using the following approach in your own environment 
(like Jupyter Notebook, Excel, or SQL):

Order Details Report Overview
Merge Order & Payment Data
Merge customer_orders.csv and payments.csv on order_id to get a full view:

report_df = pd.merge(
    orders_df,
    payments_df,
    on='order_id',
    how='left'
)[['order_id', 'customer_id', 'order_date', 'order_amount', 'order_status',
   'payment_date', 'payment_amount', 'payment_method', 'payment_status']]


Key Metrics
Here are the metrics to compute

| Metric                        | Description                              |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Total Orders                 | Count of unique `order_id`s              |
| Total Revenue                | Sum of `order_amount`                    |
| Total Paid                   | Sum of `payment_amount` where completed  |
| Average Order Value (AOV)    | Mean of `order_amount`                   |
| Payment Completion Rate (%)  | % of payments with status = "completed"  |

Use pandas methods like .sum(), .mean(), and .value_counts() to compute.

# Task 4: Order Details Report

# Merge orders and payments data on order_id
merged_df = pd.merge(
    orders_df,
    payments_df,
    on='order_id',
    how='left',
    suffixes=('_order', '_payment')
)

# Select and rename relevant columns
report_df = merged_df[[
    'order_id',
    'customer_id',
    'order_date',
    'order_amount',
    'order_status',
    'payment_date',
    'payment_amount',
    'payment_method',
    'payment_status'
]]

# Generate summary statistics
total_orders = report_df['order_id'].nunique()
total_revenue = report_df['order_amount'].sum()
total_paid = report_df[report_df['payment_status'] == 'completed']['payment_amount'].sum()
avg_order_value = report_df['order_amount'].mean()
payment_completion_rate = round((report_df['payment_status'] == 'completed').mean() * 100, 2)

# Create a summary dictionary
summary_metrics = {
    "Total Orders": total_orders,
    "Total Revenue (₹)": round(total_revenue, 2),
    "Total Paid (₹)": round(total_paid, 2),
    "Average Order Value (₹)": round(avg_order_value, 2),
    "Payment Completion Rate (%)": payment_completion_rate
}

report_df.head(), summary_metrics

Payment Status Breakdown

Status	Count	Percentage
Completed	4,991	33.3%
Pending	5,006	33.4%
Failed	5,003	33.4%
 Only 1 in 3 payments is successful, while ~66% are either pending or failed — this is a critical issue impacting cash flow and order fulfillment.

2. Overall Payment Failure Rate
Failure Rate: 33.35%

A failure rate above 30% suggests systemic issues, possibly due to gateway failures, customer errors, or network problems.

3. Failure Rate by Payment Method

Payment Method	% of Failed Payments
Bank Transfer	35.14%
Credit Card	33.30%
PayPal	31.56%
Insight:
Bank transfers have the highest failure share. This may be due to:

Manual entry errors

Slower verification processes

Greater dependency on banking infrastructure uptime

4. Monthly Trend of Failed Payments (Sample)

Month	Failed Payments
Jan 2020	89
Feb 2020	78
Mar 2020	66
Apr 2020	73
May 2020	80
Monthly failed transactions are consistently high, suggesting the issue is persistent and not seasonal.

Recommendations
Investigate root causes of failures — especially for bank transfers.

Encourage use of lower-failure methods (e.g., PayPal).

Automate retry mechanisms or notify users to resolve payment issues.

Monitor pending payments for conversion or escalation.

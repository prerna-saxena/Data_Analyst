Here are some examples of customer retention cohort analysis heatmaps that illustrate how businesses visualize and interpret customer retention over time:

Example 1: Cohort Retention Heatmap in Holistics
Holistics provides a dedicated Retention Heatmap visualization, where each row represents a cohort (e.g., customers who signed up in a particular month), and each column represents the retention rate in subsequent months. The cells are color-coded to indicate retention percentages, allowing for quick identification of trends.​

Example 2: Userpilot's Cohort Analysis Heatmap
Userpilot offers cohort analysis tools that generate heatmaps to track user retention. In their visualization, users are grouped into cohorts based on their sign-up date, and the heatmap displays the percentage of users who return in subsequent days or weeks. Darker shades indicate higher retention rates.​

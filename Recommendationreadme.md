Using cohort analysis, customers were grouped by their first purchase month and tracked over subsequent months to evaluate retention. Each row (cohort) shows how many customers returned in the following months.

ðŸ§  Key Observations:
Strong Initial Retention: Most cohorts show high retention in Month 1, indicating customers are likely to place a second order shortly after their first.

Gradual Drop-off: Retention percentages decline sharply after Month 2 or 3 across cohorts, which is typical for consumer businesses, but signals missed opportunities for long-term engagement.

Cohort Consistency: Retention patterns are stable across months, showing consistent onboarding but limited long-term loyalty.

High-Frequency Segment: A small group of customers makes 4+ repeat purchases, showing potential for a loyalty-focused strategy.

ðŸ’¡ Recommendations for Alt Mobility
1. Target Low-Frequency Customers
Most users make 1â€“2 purchases.

Implement email/SMS re-engagement campaigns within the first 30â€“60 days after first purchase to boost Month 2 retention.

2. Introduce Loyalty Programs
Reward repeat behavior with incentives (discounts, exclusive deals).

Build a points or referral system to drive recurring usage.

3. Segment-Based Personalization
Create campaigns for "Low" vs "High" value segments.

Promote service upgrades or additional leasing features to high-frequency customers.

4. A/B Test Retention Campaigns
Experiment with different offers or nudges post-purchase.

Measure impact on cohort retention to optimize future efforts.

5. Leverage BI Dashboards
Build a live retention dashboard (Power BI/Tableau) to monitor retention trends in real-time and track the effect of marketing or policy changes.

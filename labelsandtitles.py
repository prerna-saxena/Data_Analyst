What Each Label Means:
Title: Describes the plot purpose: retention trends by cohort

X-axis: "Months Since First Purchase" = how many months after the first order

Y-axis: "Cohort Month" = the month in which the customer placed their first order

Color Bar: Labeled as "Retention Rate (%)" for clarity

Annotations: Shows exact retention % in each cell (like 52.3%)
